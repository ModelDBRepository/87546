NEURON mod files from the paper:

Federico Minneci, Mahyar Janahmadi, Michele Migliore, Natasa
Dragicevic, Daniela Avossa, and Enrico Cherubini, Signaling properties
of stratum oriens interneurons in the hippocampus of transgenic mice
expressing EGFP in a subset of somatostatin-containing cells,
Hippocampus 17:538-553 (2007).

The simulation file can be used to reproduce the traces in Fig.10c of
the paper, modeling the effects of electrical coupling between cells
with various firing patterns.  In the simulation window, "amp. reg"
and "amp.clust." are the amplitude of the current injection in the
regular or cluster type of interneuron, respectively.  ggap is the gap
junctional conductance of each gap junction.  The default values of
the parameters reproduce the middle trace in Fig.10c


Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui forfig-10c.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on the simulation file
forfig-10c.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Running the model in the default setting displays:
